# NoFlash

This is a GNOME theme that disables the annoying flash effect when a screenshot is taken (by making the effect transparent, meh).

## Installation

1. Install Gnome Tweaks (`sudo apt install gnome-tweaks`)
2. Install the ["User Themes"](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/19/user-themes/) GNOME extension
3. Copy the `NoFlash` directory from this repo to `$HOME/.themes/`
4. In Gnome Tweaks, go to "Appearance", select "Shell" and choose "NoFlash"
